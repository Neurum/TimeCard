# TimeCard

This is a WIP.  It will be a timecard system for a local business in my area.  I can later make it generic to work for any company that still uses a paper or spreadsheet timecard system.

## Features
- Login for each employee that will only show their time cards.
- Can view but not edit past pay periods
- Submit each day and once submitted can't be edited except by management.
- Can view current hours worked, current PTO hours remaining and current number of days used w/o pay
- Managment can edit pay periods if there are mistakes.  
- Save to PDF format to submit to payroll department.
- Management and Owner can create accounts for new employees and give temp password which employee will be required to change on first login.
- More features to come ...
